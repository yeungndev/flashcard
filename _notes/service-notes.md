1. When choosing which plates to run first from the trays being carried upstairs, please prioritize the hot food first.
2. QR selling is the perfect opportunitiy to make a menu. How can you sell a custom menu in the QR era? What are soome great menus you can offer repeat guests?
3. Food presentations are part of the Nobu experience, please brush up on your food knowledge and dish presentations. Runners please describe one dish of your choice.

## Reminders & Updates
- The Bento Box now includes a sponge cake under the gelato instead of cocoa nibs. The sponge is gluten free but contains almonds. It can be modified to be nut free in the event of an allergy.
- Yasai Maki has been added to the menu under Vegetables.
- Chicken and Beef kushiyaki have been added under hot dishes at all meal periods.
- Next step is very important and part of our seamless communication. Next step (wiping tables, desserts set up, etc) can be done by any staff member who is not busy.
