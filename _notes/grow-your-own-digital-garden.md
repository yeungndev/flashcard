Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a DigitalGardens community on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop new transformative [tools](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) for thought.

I collected a list of [wikis](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked) I liked the most for inspiration.

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
